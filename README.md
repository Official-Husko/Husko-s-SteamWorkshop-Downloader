# Husko's SteamWorkshop Downloader  
  
üî¥**IMPORTANT**‚ùóüî¥  
Firstly this tool is partially on hold until we find a way to integrate [SteamCMD][4] into it.  
Secondly, The Tool is currently being rewritten so updates will be slow and only on the dev & web-ui test branch until it is stable for a release!  

<br />

With this tool you can download and install mods from the SteamWorkshop Easily.
This tool will download the file you entered via the steam workshop link and install it in the folder you configured.

Don't Have python installed? No problem, you can grab the compiled exe in the [Releases][2] Section.

The bot will ask for an app_id of the game you want to download mods for. This id can easily be obtained by going to the steam store of the game and copying it. For example if you want to use it for stormworks you would get this ID: https://store.steampowered.com/app/573090/Stormworks_Build_and_Rescue/ >>>>> 573090  
  
Other Infos can be found on the [Wiki][1]!
